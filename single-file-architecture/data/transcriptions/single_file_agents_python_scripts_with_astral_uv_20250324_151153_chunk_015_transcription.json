  "text": "is the wave. The next wave that's upon us is agentic coding. When you fully close the loop, what you end up with is systems that can operate on their own. So stay tuned, stay locked in. I hope you can understand why agents are so important in the age of AI. You first start with the prompt. You then move to prompt chains. You have a series of LLM-based calls that can do work on your behalf. And then you move to AI agents, right? The structure where you give them the tools they need to solve the problem. And then you let them learn, gather information, execute, get feedback. Agents is how we continue to scale our compute. This is where we're going to be focused on the channel. It's all about scaling compute usage, maximizing what you can do. It's all about AI coding so that you can write faster than ever, so that you can build out these agents fast, just to come full circle here. That's why the single file agent pattern is so important, because we meet at the intersection of three important innovations. We have Astral's UV, allowing us to bundle dependencies into a single file. We have self-validating agent patterns, where we can write great tools and great prompts to allow the agent to self-verify before it returns the response to us. And then of course, we have powerful AI coding techniques. Many of these we cover in principle AI coding. This lets us reuse, scale, clone, and duplicate our single file AI agents into many different domains. You can imagine we have an agent that builds agents. Okay. So we have a lot of big ideas to cover on the channel. If you're interested in this, if you made it this far in the video, you know what to do. Drop the like, drop the sub, leave a comment, stay connected, and whatever happens, stay focused and keep building.",
