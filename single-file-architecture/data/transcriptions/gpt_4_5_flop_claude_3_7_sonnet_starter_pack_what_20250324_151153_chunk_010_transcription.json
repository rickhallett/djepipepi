We can just copy this one What is the weather in Germany right now? I'm just going to fire that off and you can see there. My tool is getting called right my MCP server git forecast passing in the parameter Germany All right, so that's gonna call 37 partly cloudy Wow high humidity there, right? All right, so great call it again and again and again, right it's an agent just push it push the compute, right? So now it's gonna make three tool calls. Bam. Bam. Bam, Germany, Chicago, San Fran. Very nice All right, push it even further get the weather in all these places output it to a markdown file, right? So copy paste same deal push the capabilities push the agent see what I can really really do, right? I can almost guarantee you you're not pushing this agent far enough You're not pushing agents far enough, especially when it's powered by this incredible clod 3.7 sonnet look at this. So, you know pull the weather. It's calling the create tool, right? And of course when hit yes now, it's saved. Yes get status We now have that new weather file open that up format it nice breakdown of the weather, right single prompt firing off What was that six tools and you know, that's the kind of key idea here I know I'm being repetitive. This hasn't been made clear enough the actual innovation that's happening here claw code is incredible because it is putting together the Model that can call the series of tools to get the job you want done Completed right? That's that's the real innovation here. It's the model. It's the framework of MCP and it's a great showcase of those things coming out of claw code, right? And of course, you know some of the obvious commands here we can hit slash cost It looks like it's modeled very closely after a ter and you know other great terminal based tools Let's go ahead and push it even further Here's a fun one right warmest to coolest list the temperatures in the capital of all these countries in an output to warmest coldest capitals in a markdown table, right so",
