Okay. So this is the atomic composable architecture as you can see here There are pros and cons to the structure. Let's move on. The layered architecture is the most popular Widely known widely established pattern. Okay, you basically just have arbitrary layers Arbitrary directories and they are a logical collection of files. So, you know typical one might be interface layer You know your API endpoints your data models your business logic and then like utilities, right? There's a very kind of typical structure We can you know Just quickly open up literally any code base and you can find that right if we look at the Postgres code base you hit source You can see this architecture Everywhere, right? It's just the simplest architecture. It's dynamic. It allows you to scale really well You can see we have a bunch of folders that contain specific functionality, right? We can see the same thing in the Redis code base Redis is interesting because it is a relatively flat architecture with a bunch of header and C files But nonetheless, this is a classic layered architecture just a breeze through this one. There's a clear separation of concerns It's easy to understand the responsibilities and boundaries of every directory cons here is Basically you you have to import across these layers your AI coding tools must operate across API modules services utils, right? They have to operate across Everything. This is the trade-off that you make when you build and when you use this architecture, right? And it's important to note that this is likely the most popular architecture, right? The most popular architecture is us having to import a bunch of stuff into the context window So I think this is a really important thing to keep an eye on is the layered",
