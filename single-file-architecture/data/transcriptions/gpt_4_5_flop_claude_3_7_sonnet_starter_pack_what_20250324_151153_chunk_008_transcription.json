I can, you know, be a lot looser with it. You can see there it's calling the fetch tool and there's the response. Fantastic. Let's go ahead and pull from the principal coding page and list the names of the lessons and descriptions of every single lesson. So let's copy this, paste this, and let's watch Cloud Code get to work. So again, it's calling that fetch tool. The tool has pagination built in. It's going to, you know, get the next end pages so that we don't get too much back in one shot. But you can see this right here, right? These are all the names. Hello AI Coding World, their IDKs, spec-based AI coding, let the code write itself, so on and so forth. It's doing a great job here. It used that tool and it processed everything exactly the way we needed it to very, very quickly. And again, I'm going to sound like a broken record, but it just called a tool. These are tools that the agent has access to and can properly call. This is why in the beginning I mentioned that this is the most important benchmark chart here, okay? It's the agentic tool use. I don't think it's truly understood currently how important this benchmark is. You need to be able to call the right tool when you need it for powerful agentic tools, applications, and to build powerful agents, you need precise tool calling. This is great. We can do even more with this, right? So we can do the same thing as an agent. So you can just ask itself back to back to back. So we're going to do the exact same thing. And then we're saying, then write these to a markdown file, all right? So just a couple more examples here. I just want to, you know, really nail this point home searching through the page that I think is this tool. It's making multiple tool calls to fetch. And then at the end, it's going to, there we go, it's going to run the right tool, okay? Right tool, right? You can see file path. Let's go ahead and say yes. Normally I run this in YOLO mode and it just kind of, you know, does all the work for me. We can type gs. This is get status. And you can see",
