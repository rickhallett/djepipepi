  "text": "What's up engineers, NDDevDan here. Something I think about a lot is how can we maximize our compute usage with powerful AI agents while steering clear of the roadmap of companies like OpenAI. When OpenAI releases an agent, 1,256 startups are immediately destroyed, eviscerated. For example, if you were building a research agent, OpenAI's deep research just ate your breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Imagine all your time, engineering resources, and time investment vanished, instantly cooked. From startups to individual engineers, it doesn't matter how great your work is, or how far you've scaled your AI coding, or what technical innovation you've found, if you invest in the wrong agent, in the wrong tool, in the wrong product, you're at risk of getting bulldozed by OpenAI and other gen tech companies. How can we stay ahead and build powerful, effective agents while staying out of the way of the generative AI roadmap? I spend a lot of time in this space and I want to share a pattern with you for building powerful, lean, compute-gobbling AI agents that can help you move fast, iterate, and scale your compute usage while staying out of the way. Then, near the end of this video, we're going to discuss why we care about agents so much, and I'll explain why I and other engineers are so obsessed with agents. Agents are everything, and I'll explain why in this video. By using Astral's all-in-one Python tool, UV, and by combining it with powerful AI coding techniques, we can build and deploy single-file agents. So what is a single-file agent, and how does it help us move fast, scale our compute, and avoid getting disrupted by big tech companies? I have this simple project here in Cursor, and right away you'll notice something weird. We only have two files. We have a file database,",
