  "text": "But I would also start to do some visionary exercises to stimulate my brain to help me have the experiences I'm looking for. In other words, can you close your eyes and imagine what it would be to see in a 180, a 360, a spherical view, or at least a broader spectrum? So in other words, let's say you know how to simulate a chair, you can simulate a table and stuff. Okay, but none of those really have five senses or whatever, whatnot. So the next thing is, is that can you simulate a dog? Okay, can you imagine what it is to perceive from the eyes of the dog? Can you imagine smelling with the nose of a dog? Okay, now it doesn't matter whether you have the full spectrum of scent, it's the idea that you can get the general idea. Because if you can do that and you practice with that, and then you go to bed and you have a dream, that is like watching the spider or watching the waterfall. Okay, now you are saying to yourself, you want to do different things. So if you did a horse, you'd have a wider vision. Okay, so you'd have to work and concentrate on a horse to see the wider view. Okay, and keep working with that, working with that, working with that, because it's going to be a closer concept for you to leap to do something a fourth dimension or a more broader spectrum of vision. So you're really, you're teaching your brain to kind of expand its capabilities. You're, I mean, think about it differently. When you imagine in your brain, it's a very much a two dimensional or three dimensional experience, it's just like life. You don't really see what's behind you, but you have a certain amount of vision, like take your hands and you can just kind of tell about where your peripheral vision is. Okay, you see the limit of that. So if you imagine your eyes were a bit wider, okay, and you visualize in your mind that you can do that.",
