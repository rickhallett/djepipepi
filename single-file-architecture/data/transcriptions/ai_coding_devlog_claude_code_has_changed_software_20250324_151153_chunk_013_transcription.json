Cloud Code is even more powerful when you add a tool, but when you start stacking these MCP servers together, you get something truly extraordinary. So that's what we're going to do here. We're going to add Fetch to make it easier to put together these pocket pick items. So again, I'm adding documentation, right? I highly recommend you don't just copy this stuff and fire it once. Make it reusable, right? Make it easy for yourself to keep winning. Make it easy for yourself to move fast. So creating that command there, and then I'm going to end this session, move back to Cloud Code, kill this session. You can see there that was a 13 cent session, not cheap for the little work that we did. But there we go, right? So added that server, validated it with MCP list, and now we can click off Cloud with a brand new MCP server connected, right? So now we have the ability to make web requests. I'm going to the Gemini docs, and you can guess what I'm going to do here, right? Copy the URL, Fetch, Gemini web page. Then I'm saying then add pocket pick item. Then of course, I'll specify tags. So we're going to say LLM, Models, Gemini, and Flash. So whenever I want to look up this pocket pick item, I can just search for LLM, Models, Gemini, or Flash, right? So there it is. We need to give YOLO mode access to scrape this entire page over and over. So that's what we're doing. We're letting Cloud Code operate in its highest efficiency mode, right? Which is YOLO mode. It's just agentic, right? It did make a mistake here. I want all the content. It's doing some trimming. This is one of the annoying parts about some of these models. They try to reduce context sometimes. So you have to be explicit every once in a while. And there we go. So we saw that new Gemini pocket pick item got added. Fantastic. So now I can run lists, again, information that's keyword there, PPick, tags, and there we go. So there are all of my",
