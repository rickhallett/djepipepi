  "text": "What's up engineers? Indie dev Dan here. There is zero debate in the tech ecosystem. You and I and almost every builder knows that all code will soon be written by AI coding agents. A natural next question is then how can we design our code bases to be optimal for our AI coding tools? If our AI coding agents are going to be operating our code bases, we should be designing our code bases to be token efficient. It doesn't matter if you're using Cursor, Zed, Cloud Code, Adr, or Windsurf. These tools will all change and evolve. Some will die, some will thrive. What matters is how you architect systems of context that can be easily understood and operated by your AI coding tools. Always keep in mind the big three, context, model, prompt. So in this video, we're going to explore the question, what is the optimal code base architecture for AI coding and AI agents? Why is this important? It's important because if you manage your context, you manage your results. In the generative AI age, this is the name of the game. If you manage your context, you will manage your results. Let's break down the key questions we're going to answer. What is the optimal code base architecture for AI coding? What is the optimal code base architecture for building AI agents? And then lastly and most importantly, does it matter at all? As AI coding tools progress, as new agentic tools like Cloud Code emerge, we have to zoom out and answer the question, does it matter at all? Great engineers always stop to ask if the problem they're trying to solve is worth solving at all. Does it matter what our code base architecture looks like? If these three questions interest you, stick around and let's start with a popular yet misused code base architecture. This is the",
