So I'm being specific about what library I want used here. Update tools and prompt to reference SQLite. Okay because if we open up this file you can see here if we just search DuckDB we have you know many references. You can see on the side here we have many references to DuckDB. So that's it. That's the prompt. I'm going to copy this and I have this kind of reusable AI coding configuration. Right you can think of this as a kind of just generic AI coding script that we can call that runs a compute enhanced AI coding chain of assistants. Right we have two aider assistants in architect mode. We're just going to copy this. We do dollar sign pb paste. That's it. So this is going to update. It's going to kick off two AI coding assistants running back to back. This is our first shot and this is our reflection step. Right all right so there we go. We're getting our changes. We're updating our tool calls to reference SQLite instead of DuckDB. And then at some point here we're going to see our prompt get updated. So you can see there all those tools. That looks great. We're on final SQL query. Now we're referencing SQLite instead of DuckDB. You can see we had an update in the prompt and now we're running the reflection. Right so remember the reflection is literally just this. Double check all changes. Request it and we're pacing the prompt in again. So let's see what happens now. We've already taken one shot at architect and editor with aider and now we're running again. So you can see here look at how many things were missed. Right we have the architect saying hey you missed this here. Hey you missed this here. And then the editor is coming in and actually changing those things. Right so we can now search SQLite. And so we should see a bunch of references to SQLite now with that new syntax. As a test we can also come in here and search DuckDB. Right so this is really good. We don't see any references to DuckDB anymore. Fantastic. And now we should be able to run our SQLite agent just as we did our DuckDB OpenAI agent. So in order to do that we need to pull in an SQLite.",
