  "text": "architecture the best for AI coding tools? I doubt that. So that's the layered architecture. You know, the pros here is that you can really operate quickly and add new functionality, right? If you think about what this architecture means in terms of how businesses operate and how dev shops operate, you really want to be able to add and modify things quickly, right? That's kind of the core here. And usually, you know, there is some type of layered atomic architecture embedded inside of the layered architecture. For instance, your utils is usually the bottom level, right? Your utils are, if we back up here, your atoms, right? That's kind of where it all breaks down, though, right? Because after that, you could have imports cutting across all types of modules, right? And it's not clear, you know, looking at a code base, like, for instance, if we, you know, hop back to the Postgres database, and we click source, it's not clear at all who's importing who and what the rules are there, right? This is the layered architecture, super popular. I'm not saying this architecture is bad. It's here for a reason. It allows us to scale and move and build without thinking too much, right? You need a new API, jump to the API layer. You need a new model, jump into the models directory, so on and so forth, right? Again, the biggest con here is that your AI really has to look across every one of these directories, right? Cloud code, cursor, agent mode, you have to look across all of these files. And of course, that's going to chew up tokens. So let's move on to a super exciting architecture. I've talked to several principal AI coding members about the vertical slice architecture. It's come up over and over and over, you know, to give it away. I think the vertical slice architecture is the optimal architecture for AI coding tools and for agentic coding tools. Let me explain why. Let's just take a look at this, okay? You're going to get it right away. It's very, very simple to understand why this could be optimal for AI coding tools. Everything is a slice, okay? We have a features directory that contains a directories, which contain all of the functionality for a specific feature inside.",
