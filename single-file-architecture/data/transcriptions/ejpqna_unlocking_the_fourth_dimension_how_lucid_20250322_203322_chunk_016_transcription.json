And I revel in it, I revel in it until it becomes fucking nothing of interest to me no more. I've seen it. So your brain doesn't give it to you again. It's a child annoying you. Lookie, lookie, but you know what everybody does? You always ignore the child. You don't stop for a minute and when the kid says, I want to color my hair purple, you're just like, no, you're not going to color your hair purple. Really? You're going to color your hair purple? Wow, that's very interesting. And just wait, just wait, let it run its course. Don't be fucking right away following the patterns. So in other words, if your brain is going to go through all the work to distract you, look at the detail of what it's distracting you with. Look at the quality of the sound of whatever you're hearing. Look at the conversation, the in-depth, the intricate thought that went into fucking fooling you. It's genius. Genius. OK, look at their clothing, look at their features, look at the fucking if they're showing you fucking art or they're showing you something, fucking say, hey, you got a microscope. Can I can I take a look in there and see what you guys got? It will blow your mind. And when you start to do that, things start the engine that that designs all of that, OK, starts to work for you. I can't even tell you how many times I've woken out of a dream going, that was fucking amazing. Fucking amazing. It's flawless. Next. You you got it, you got to do things differently.",
